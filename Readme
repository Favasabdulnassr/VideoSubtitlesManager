# Video Subtitle Manager

## Overview

The Video Subtitle Manager allows users to upload videos, extract multiple subtitles, and select from them through a small interface in the video player. It includes a search functionality that enables users to search for specific words, phrases, or letters within subtitles. The search results display the related subtitle sentences with timestamps. When a timestamp is clicked, the video will automatically start playing from that specific point.
